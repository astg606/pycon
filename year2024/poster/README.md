<b>Abstract:</b> \\
At any given time, it is possible to know the planar position 
(latitude, longitude) of the International Space Station (ISS). 
The ISS cycles the globe every 90 minutes. 
We write a Python application 
(relying on the packages Pandas, Shapely, GeoPandas and MovingPandas) 
that collects a time series (over several hours) of the positions of the ISS, 
identifies the cycles (each time the ISS crosses the central meridian), 
and plots the tracks. 
We also determine the weather current conditions (temperature, wind speed) 
of each land point along the track and perform interactive visualizations.
